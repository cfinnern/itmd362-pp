# Production Problem 8: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that object’s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the week-12/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral:I love the way the watch look. Sure there are other watches that can do the exact same thing,
and sure there were cheaper watches, but I just loved how this one worked. Most of the smart watched,
especially at the time when I bought it, were square. But this was different.

* Behavioral:I wear my watch every day. I love getting all of my notifications without having to pull out
my phone or even having to keep my phone on me. I can use it at work, where I’m not allowed to have
my phone on me; or in the shower to change music to keep me singing.

* Reflective:I always get the same questions about the watch: is that an apple watch? No. can you text
from it? Yes. But when people are honestly interested in it, I’ll tell them and show them everything it can
do. From navigation to voice commands. I love showing it off and even giving suggestions to other smart
watches that might fit them if they are interested.

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 3/MyIIT redesign:

1.Behavioral: We could try to make the website as simple as possible. To the point where the user wont even have to think twice about what they are doing
2.Visceral: make the site pretty. maybe a nice skyline photo on the login
3.Visceral: But not too many photos where it becomes overwelming and distracting to the user. This still is a portal for a school site
