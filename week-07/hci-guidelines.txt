# Production Problem 5: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment.

You only need to sketch your redesign, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/
* Android Design Guidelines:
  http://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://dev.windows.com/en-us/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL):https://www.google.com/design/spec/patterns/navigation-drawer.html
* How you implemented it in your sketch:I made a sidebar to be able to access all the other features of my.iit.edu
I feel like this would hide the things people don’t use as often as the log in, which is behind the sidebar.
this in turn would keep my.iit.edu as simple as possible

* HCI Guidline Two (URL):https://www.google.com/design/spec/animation/authentic-motion.html#authentic-motion- mass-weight
* How you implemented it in your sketch:the sidebar would slide out with asymmetric motion. this
helps the animation seem less ridged and more fluid by having the side bar accelerate and decelerate as it goes in and out

* HCI Guidline Three (URL):https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/Principles.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH4- SW1
* How you implemented it in your sketch:I implemented this into my sketch by having the button
change colors when clicked this lets the user know with a visual, that they did in fact click the button. Also, I made the text boxes
have rounded edges giving it a more friendly feel than sharp edges
