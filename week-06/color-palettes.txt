# Production Problem 4: Color Palettes for HCI

## The Problem

Using either Adobe Color CC (https://color.adobe.com/), Paletton (http://paletton.com/), or another
Web-based palette generator of your choosing, you will create a number of different color palettes,
based on the requirements in the Deliverables section below.

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) screenshots of your web-based palette for the four palettes below;
2) an explanation, after each palette request below, why you chose the colors you did

* A monochromatic palette for a website that creates high-end, custom-made gaming laptops.

Explanation of your color choices:I decided to go with a red because when I think if a gaming laptop I think if red. 
A lot of gaming laptops I have had experience with are usually green or red and I personally prefer the red. 
I also chose to make most of the colors fairly dark, again because that’s what I think of when I think of gaming. 
Also, I feel like most gamers are not in a fully lit room, but instead, a pretty dark one.


* A shaded color palette for a website that sells natural and organic foods.

Explanation of your color choices:I decided to go with a lot of green because when you think organic food, 
you think green. I also went towards the blue side of the green because blue is associated with water and nature, 
again, giving it the organic feel I want. I also went fairly light with the colors to draw attention to the products.


* A complementary palette for a banking website.

Filename:bank.jpg
Explanation of your color choices:I obviously went for a green starting color. I started near the blue green side, 
however, the complementary color to that was kind of red, which is what I wanted to stay away from. This is because 
red is associated with losing money. So I went toward the yellow side of it, giving the complementary color of purple. 
Finally, I played around with the sliders until I got light colors as because I wanted them to seem very happy.


* A triadic palette for a website that offers games for children.

Filename:children.jpg
Explanation of your color choices:For this last one, I assumed that the kids in this were very young. 
So, I went very light and neutral colors. I didn’t want any colors to be too intense and wanted them all to be 
soothing. I also tried to get very basic colors. Green, blue, dark green, red, and pink. I wanted the colors 
to be distinguishable from one another but also have different shades of the colors for kids to name or at 
least to draw some attention.
