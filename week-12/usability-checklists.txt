# Production Problem 7: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items. Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you've found:

1.https://web.wsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2015/08/25-point-usability-checklist-final.pdf
2. http://www.studyweb.com/test-your-website-a-57-point-checklist-for-maximum-usability/

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1.Calls to action (e.g. register, apply, submit, add to basket) are clear, well labelled, and appear clickable
2. Simplicity: give the user what they are looking for
3. Your site shouldn't look like an advertisement 
4. All major areas of the site are accessible from the home page
5. The sites purpose is easily understood
6. No unnecessary animations
7. Logo. Make sure your visitors know what site they are on
8. Make sure your oage loads quickly
9. Revise. Make sure you do a spell check
10. Legibility, make sure the font size is right and the colors are not too distracting.
